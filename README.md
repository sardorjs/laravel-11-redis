## 3. Start the Containers

Bring up the containers to initialize the environment:

```bash
make up
```



## 4. Install Dependencies

Once the containers are running, enter the container and install the PHP dependencies:

```bash
make cli
composer install
```

## 5. Set Directory Permissions

Ensure the `storage` and `bootstrap/cache` directories are writable by running:

make cli
chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
```

## 6. Generate Application Key

```

## 8. Run Database Migrations

Apply the migrations to set up the database schema:
